# XERIF:WARMLINK
## Find objects linked with yours that need to be checked.

Sometimes is we don't have time to write 100% cohesive code and we can find in our projects objects strongly connected with others.
For this situation each update needs to be followed with a check in other files and retests.

* `xerif-warmlink` is here to organize this situation.
